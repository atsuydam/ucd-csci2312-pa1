*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

 The program Point runs a variety of tests to compute
 the areas of a variety of triangles formed in a three
 dimensional area.

Name: main.cpp
    Implements the tests from the file PointTests.cpp
    and reports which tests failed. Written by the
    class instructor Ivo Georgiev

Name: PointTest.h
    Function declarations for the PointTests functions
    Written by Ivo Georgiev

Name: PointTests.cpp
    Function definitions for the PointTests ran in main.cpp.
    Written by Ivo Georgiev

Name: ErrorContext.h
    Function declarations for the Error functions which report
    out which tests failed and what line of code in PointTests.cpp
    they relate to for debugging. Written by Ivo Georgiev

Name: ErrorContext.cpp
    Function definitions for ErrorContext.h.
    Written by Ivo Georgiev

Name: Point.h
    Defines the Point class for a three dimensional point
    defined at x, y, and z.
    Written by Ivo Georgiev but edited by Amanda Suydam to
    three dimensions from the original 2 dimensional point
    (x,y).

Name: Point.cpp
    Function definitions for the Point.h class.
    Written by Amanda Suydam

Name: area.cpp
    Declares and defines the area function to be used by
    the Point class. It takes three defined points and
    computes the area between them using Heron's formula.
